What are the key emotions + actions in dojo?
    - curiosity + discovery (learning what is possible)
    - satisfaction + initial learning & incremental improvement
        + the quick flash of first getting it & the slow-burning glow of locking it in
    - delight + deployment of mastery
        + actually deploying the skills is beyond the scope of dojo.
        + though if we had a kata section . . .
